I worked on LF and PLF  with ubuntu's snap "coq-prover",
which is the 2023.11 release of the coq platform.

I used 2023.03 for VC because the version of Princeton VST was too new.
2023.03 has version 2.12, while the version of software foundations
I used asks for version 2.11.1. I'm hoping this will be close enough.
